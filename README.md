# Identify-and-Predict-Credit-Card-Defaulter---Advanced-Data-Science
Used Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees to create predictive models and interpret them. Found a significant relation for each algorithm in the data to create multivariate models.

**Abstract :** In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the **cash and credit card debt crisis** and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan **over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants.** At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, **overused credit card** for consumption and accumulated **heavy credit and cash–card debts.** The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders.In a well-developed financial system, **crisis management**
is on the downstream and risk prediction is on the
upstream. The major purpose of **risk prediction** is to use
financial information, such as business financial statement,
customer transaction and repayment records, etc., to **predict business performance or individual customers’ credit
risk and to reduce the damage and uncertainty.**

Before we begin, the term **default on credit card** means that if you have **failed to make a payment on your credit card until your last due date**,your credit card company will assume that you are probably never going to do it. So in such a case, the credit card issuer will **close your account** and make a note of your debt and sell it off to a collections firm. Your debt now will be handled by the collections firm and they will keep calling you regarding your **debt** and make your life miserable. If you fail to repay it, you could be **sued and will end up in the court**. Your case will be reported to **TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian.** These are the **three major credit bureaus in the United States**. Your credit score is going to tank which means that **the bank won't easily issue you loans** and the effects will stay on your credit report for upto 7 years.                                                                          <br>
<br>                                                                                                                                                           So if you default your credit card you will be in a big trouble and could face serious consequences. 


**Aim** : To identify and Predict from the past data of the credit card if a customer will default their credit card or not. The main objective is to bring more consistency for banks when then give out loans and to find out what are the factors that will make a customer a credit card defaulter.
